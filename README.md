<!--<div style = "text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
  This project is about making comparison for KNN & RF for [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
  The goal of this project to successfully making use of supervised learning algorithm to diagnose breast cancer.
  Through the result make analysis which one is better for this case.
  The result yields KNN better than RF based on AUC-ROC.
